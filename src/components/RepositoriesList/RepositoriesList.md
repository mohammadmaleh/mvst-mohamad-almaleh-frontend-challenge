# RepositoriesList Component

The `RepositoriesList` component is a functional component written in TypeScript and React. It is used to render a list of repositories using the `antd List` component and a custom `RepositoryItem` component.

## Props

The component takes in a single prop called `repositories`, which is an array of `Repository` objects. The `Repository` object is defined in a separate file.

## State

The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the `expandedRepositoryId` variable, which is initially set to `null`. The `expandedRepositoryId` state variable is used to keep track of the currently expanded repository item.

## Functions

The component defines a function called `handleRepositoryExpand`, which is used to toggle the `expandedRepositoryId` state variable when a repository item is clicked.

The component also defines a function called `renderItems`, which is used to render each repository item in the list. It takes in a single `repository` argument and returns a `RepositoryItem` component with the appropriate props.

## Rendering

The component renders a list of repositories using the `antd List` component. The `itemLayout` prop is set to `"horizontal"`, the `dataSource` prop is set to the `repositories` prop passed into the component, and the `renderItem` prop is set to the `renderItems` function defined earlier.
